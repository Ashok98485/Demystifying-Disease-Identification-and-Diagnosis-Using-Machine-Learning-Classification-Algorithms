# Demystyfy-medical-data-
The exponential surge in healthcare data is providing new opportunities to discover meaningful datadriven characteristics and patterns of diseases. Machine learning and deep learning models have been
employed for many computational phenotyping and healthcare prediction tasks. However, machine
learning models are crucial for wide adaption in medical research and clinical decision making. In this
chapter, the authors introduce demystifying diseases identification and diagnosis of various disease
using machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, MLP classifier,
random forest in order to cure liver disease, hepatitis disease, and diabetes mellitus. This work leverages
the initial discoveries made through data exploration, statistical analysis of data to reduce the number
of explanatory variables, which led to identifying the statistically significant attributes, mapping those
significant attributes to the response, and building classification techniques to predict the outcome and
demystify clinical diseases.
